# Project: CrowdServe (University Marketplace)
- **Target Audience:** University students (Gen-Z). Premium feel inspired by Apple, Spotify, and Anthropic.
- **Tech Stack:** Next.js 14 App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Shadcn UI, Supabase.
- **Design System:**
  - Roundness: `rounded-xl` or `rounded-2xl` (Soft/Friendly, Apple-inspired).
  - Animation: Use `framer-motion` for hover states (scale up, y-shift) and list entries.
  - Vibe: Premium, minimal, glassmorphism, gradient glows, large avatars.
  - Colors: Emerald/Teal primary, Zinc neutrals, subtle gradients.
- **Geography:** Pakistan (Topi/GIKI area).
- **Currency:** PKR (Rs.).
- **Terminology:** Use "tasks" consistently (not "jobs" or "gigs" in UI).
- **Code Rules:**
  - Use `lucide-react` for icons.
  - Always separate UI components into `components/ui` or `components/features`.
  - Use "Client Components" (`"use client"`) only when interactivity is needed.
  - Use server actions for mutations (`app/actions/`).
  - Use Supabase RLS for security.
